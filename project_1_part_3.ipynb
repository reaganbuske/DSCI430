Place the code necessary to read in the data from the file in the past part and create a list of column names called `common_columns`.  Be sure to also include all necessary import statements.  Save this file and verify that you can import `common_columns` from this module using `from project_data_lastname import common_columns` in a Jupyter notebook (again replace `lastname` with your last name and make sure the notebook and the python file are both located in the course root directory)."
